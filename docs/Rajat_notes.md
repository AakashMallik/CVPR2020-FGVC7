# CVPR 2020 - FGVC ( Plant Pathology )
Stuff that i need to read 

- Preprocessing Pipeline- Autoaugment, RandAugment 
- Modelling- EfficientNet, Noisy Training of EfficientNet, Fixing train-test time resolution problem 

# Models to checkout

[1] Resnet + DenseNet is ok, but many to one mappings relies on feature concatenation
[2] EfficientNet is ok, but i need to read that. Will read
[3] EfficientNet distilled into a student network via semi supervision might work.


# Some stuff from the past competitions

iMaterialist Challenge on Product Recognition

Before reading this, please complete autoaugment, and Destruction/Construction learning (http://ylbai.me/DCL_cvpr19.pdf) paper.
