# CVPR 2020 - FGVC ( Plant Pathology )
Stuff that i need to read 

- Preprocessing Pipeline- Autoaugment, RandAugment 
- Modelling- EfficientNet, Noisy Training of EfficientNet, Fixing train-test time resolution problem, SeResNext, InceptionNext.

- Loss functions - Class balanced focal loss in S/E Networks

# Models to checkout

[1] Resnet + DenseNet is ok, but many to one mappings relies on feature concatenation
[2] EfficientNet is ok, but i need to read that. Will read
[3] EfficientNet distilled into a student network via semi supervision might work.


# Some stuff from the past competitions

1. iMaterialist Challenge on Product Recognition
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-product-2019/discussion/94536
  - Before reading this, please complete autoaugment, and Destruction/Construction learning (http://ylbai.me/DCL_cvpr19.pdf) paper.

2. Old Winner Approaches from Last Year Competition
