# CVPR 2020 - FGVC ( Plant Pathology )


# Models to checkout

[1] Resnet + DenseNet is ok, but many to one mappings relies on feature concatenation
[2] EfficientNet is ok, but i need to read that. Will read
[3] EfficientNet distilled into a student network via semi supervision might work.


# Some stuff from the past competitions


# My own ideas
[1] The prediction of confidence intervals will always be relative. Will using dynamic
binarization in multi class setting hold any value? Or, is it limited to Semantic segmentation.


# Stuff I need to read
I  have only read abstract and seen figures right now.

[1] AutoAugment

Leverages reinforcement learning for optimal policy finding. Search space consists of a
policy and the probability values in the sampling process. Have to check if the goal is
only better performance on val, or do we need to keep some notion of perceptual loss.  

[2] EfficientNet
