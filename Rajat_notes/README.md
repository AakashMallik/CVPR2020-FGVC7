# CVPR 2020 - FGVC ( Plant Pathology )


# Models to checkout

[1] Resnet + DenseNet is ok, but many to one mappings relies on feature concatenation
[2] EfficientNet is ok, but i need to read that. Will read
[3] EfficientNet distilled into a student network via semi supervision might work.


# Some stuff from the past competitions


# My own ideas
[1] The prediction of confidence intervals will always be relative. Will using dynamic
binarization in multi class setting hold any value? Or, is it limited to Semantic segmentation.
